FRONTEND
In creating the UI/UX design, we used SwiftUI. Through the creation of various landing pages for the user to enter, starting from the cover page for ambi, we prompted a flow between the design and the detection of how many fingers via the camera. The second screen of the app detailed how many fingers correlated with which hardware device (the light correlated with 1 finger, the fan correlated with 2 fingers, 3 radio volume, 4 radio station), and the third screen detailed the specific adjustments (1 for on, 2 for off, 3 for increase, 4 for decrease). This tied together the hardware component with the frontend, able to visually see the guide for which fingers corresponded to which function. Additionally, our app included a built in camera function, that can be used further to detect the number of fingers. SwiftUI was used in the creation of the pages visually, as well as in implementing functionality of buttons and moving between pages.
